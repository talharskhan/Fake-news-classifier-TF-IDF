# Fake-news-classifier-TF-IDF

the data is taken from kaggel website 

the aim of this project is to classify wheather the News is fake or not using TF-IDF vectorizer

## libraries used : 
1. Pandas :- For read the data set

2. Sklearn.feature_selection for Tf-idf vectorizer :- vectorizing the data 

3. Stopwords :- connecting words which does not contribute for analysizing the data for eg : is, the, of, etc.

4. PorterStemmer :- stemming the words into there base form which may not form a dictionary word formed with the help of lammatizing.

5. Regular expression :- to clean or remove unwanted characters from the data 

5. train_test_split :- for training the data and making a better predictive model

6. matplotlib.pyplot :- For data visualization

7. naivebayes :- multinomial NB classifier for predictive analysis on the data

8.sklearn.metrics for confusion matrix and accuracy score :- to check the true possitive and false positive values and to check the accuracy of the model

9. numpy 

10. Itertools :- for iterating through the data

11. Passive Agressive classifier :- another classification approach

12. MultiNomial classifier with hyper parameter
